# Integrating a library within the hub

The Hugging Face hub aims to facilitate the sharing of machine learning models, checkpoints, and artifacts. 
This endeavor starts with the integration of its tool stack within downstream libraries, and we're happy to announce 
the fruitful collaboration between Hugging Face and SpaCy, AllenNLP, Timm, among many other incredible libraries.

We believe the model hub is a step in the correct direction for several reasons. It offers:

- Free model hosting for libraries and their users. Custom plans exist for users wishing to keep their models 
  private but keep the ease of use.
- Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach
- Hosted inference API for all models publicly available
- In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.

Thanks to these, we hope to achieve true shareability across the machine learning ecosystem, reproducibility, 
and the ability to offer simple solutions directly from the browser. To that end, we're looking to make it very 
simple to integrate the hub within downstream libraries or standalone machine learning models.

The approach can be split in three different steps detailed below:

- The "downstream" approach: downloading files from the hub so that they may be used simply locally.
- The "upstream" approach: creating repositories and uploading files to the hub directly from your library.
- Setting up the inference API for uploaded models.

Before getting started, we recommend you first [create a HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/join). This will 
create a namespace on which you can create repositories, and to which you can upload files to.

Once your account is created, jump to your environment with the `huggingface_hub` library installed and log in:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

```bash
        _|    _|  _|    _|    _|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|  _|      _|    _|_|_|      _|_|_|_|    _|_|      _|_|_|  _|_|_|_|
        _|    _|  _|    _|  _|        _|          _|    _|_|    _|  _|            _|        _|    _|  _|        _|
        _|_|_|_|  _|    _|  _|  _|_|  _|  _|_|    _|    _|  _|  _|  _|  _|_|      _|_|_|    _|_|_|_|  _|        _|_|_|
        _|    _|  _|    _|  _|    _|  _|    _|    _|    _|    _|_|  _|    _|      _|        _|    _|  _|        _|
        _|    _|    _|_|      _|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|  _|      _|    _|_|_|      _|        _|    _|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|_|

## Downstream: fetching files from the hub

The downstream approach is managed by the `huggingface_hub` library. Three methods may prove helpful when trying to 
retrieve files from the hub:

### `hf_hub_url`

This method can be used to construct the URL of a file from a given repository. For example, the 
repository `lysandre/arxiv-nlp` has a few model, configuration and tokenizer files:

![Integrating%20a%20library%20within%20the%20hub%20e1ae45ce33c84bfeacf68708e41af6b3/Untitled.png](Integrating%20a%20library%20within%20the%20hub%20e1ae45ce33c84bfeacf68708e41af6b3/Untitled.png)

We would like to fetch the configuration file of that model specifically. The `hf_hub_url` method is tailored for 
that use-case especially:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_url
>>> hf_hub_url("lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/arxiv-nlp/resolve/main/config.json'
```

This method is powerful: it can take a revision and return the URL of a file given a revision, which is the same 
as clicking on the "Download" button on the web interface. This revision can be a branch, a tag or a commit hash:

```python
>>> hf_hub_url("lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json", revision="877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/arxiv-nlp/resolve/877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a/config.json'
```

### `cached_download`

This method works hand in hand with the `hf_hub_url` method. Pass it a URL, and it will retrieve and *cache* the 
file! Let's try it with the configuration file we just retrieved thanks to the `hf_hub_url` method:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_url, cached_download
>>> config_file_url = hf_hub_url("lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
>>> cached_download(config_file_url)
'/home/lysandre/.cache/huggingface/hub/bc0e8cc2f8271b322304e8bb84b3b7580701d53a335ab2d75da19c249e2eeebb.066dae6fdb1e2b8cce60c35cc0f78ed1451d9b341c78de19f3ad469d10a8cbb1'
```

The file is now downloaded and stored in my cache: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`. It isn't necessarily noticeable for 
small files such as a configuration file - but larger files, such as model files would be hard to work with if they 
had to be re-downloaded every time. Additionally, these large files will always be downloaded with a blazing fast
download speed: we use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads across the globe.

If the repository is updated with a new version of the file we just downloaded, then the `huggingface_hub` will 
download the new version and store it in the cache next time, without any action needed from your part to specify 
it should fetch an updated version

### `snapshot_download`

The `hf_hub_url` and `cached_download` combo works wonders when you have a fixed repository structure; for example 
a model file alongside a configuration file, both with static names.

However, this is not always the case. You may choose to have a more flexible approach without sticking to a specific 
file schema. This is what the authors of AllenNLP chose to do for instance. In that case `snapshot_download` comes 
in handy: it downloads a whole snapshot of a repo's files at the specified revision. All files are nested inside a 
folder in order to keep their actual filename relative to that folder.

This is similar to what you would obtain if you were to clone the repository yourself - however, this does not 
need either git or git-lfs to work, and none of your users will need it either.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download("lysandre/arxiv-nlp")
'/home/lysandre/.cache/huggingface/hub/lysandre__arxiv-nlp.894a9adde21d9a3e3843e6d5aeaaf01875c7fade'
```

The downloaded files are, once again, cached on your system. The code above will only need to fetch the files the 
first time it is run; and if you update a file on your repository, then that method will automatically fetch the 
updated repository next time it is run.

### Finalizing the downstream approach

With the help of these three methods, implementing a download mechanism from the hub should be super simple! Please, 
feel free to open an issue if you're lost as to how apply it to your library - we'll be happy to help.

## Upstream: creating repositories and uploading files to the hub

The `huggingface_hub` library offers a few tools to make it super simple to create a repository on the hub 
programmatically, and upload files to that repository. It is based on the `HfApi` class:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi
>>> api = HfApi()
```

This class contains a few methods we're interested in: `create_repo` and `upload_file`.

While up to now we didn't need any authorization token to download files from public repositories, we will 
need one to create a repository and upload files to it. You can retrieve your token using the `HfFolder`:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfFolder
>>> folder = HfFolder()
>>> token = folder.get_token()
```

### `create_repo`

The `create_repo` method may be used to create a repository directly on the model hub. Once you have your 
token in hand

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi
>>> api = HfApi()
>>> api.create_repo(token, "test-model")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model'
```

You can choose to create repository privately, and to upload it to an organization you are part of.

### `upload_file`

The `upload_file` method may be used to upload files to a repository directly on the model hub. It needs a 
token, a path to a file, the final path in the repo, as well as the ID of the repo we're pushing to.

```python
>>> api.upload_file(
...			token, 
...			path_or_fileobj="/home/lysandre/dummy-test/README.md", 
...			path_in_repo="README.md", 
...			repo_id="lysandre/test-model"
... )
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model/blob/main/README.md'
```

### Mention of `Repository`?

### Finalizing the upstream approach

With these two methods, creating and managing repositories is done very simply.

## Setting up the Inference API

### Docker image

All third-party libraries are dockerized: in this environment, you can install the libraries you'll need for your 
models to work correctly. In order to add your library to the existing docker images, head over to 
the `[inference-api-community` docker images folder](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/api-inference-community/docker_images).

Here, you'll be facing a folder for each library already implemented - as well as a `common` folder. Copy this 
folder and paste it with the name of your library. You'll need to edit three files to make this docker image yours:

- The `requirements.txt` should be defined according to your library's needs.
- The `app/main.py` needs to mention which tasks are implemented. Look for the `IMPLEMENT_THIS` sample and update 
  it accordingly. See [AllenNLP](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/59ea9998ee2331acf1c50a9fe2f93e5606c5fefb/api-inference-community/docker_images/allennlp/app/main.py#L29) 
  or [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/59ea9998ee2331acf1c50a9fe2f93e5606c5fefb/api-inference-community/docker_images/sentence_transformers/app/main.py#L32-L33) 
  for examples.
- Finally, the meat of the changes is to be applied to each pipeline you would like to see enabled for your model. 
  Modify the files `app/pipelines/{task_name}.py` accordingly. Here too, look for the `IMPLEMENT_THIS` sample and 
  edit to fit your needs. Feel free to add any pipeline you need if it isn't among the others.

For additional information, please take a look at the README available in the`api-inference-community` [folder](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/api-inference-community). 
This README contains information about the tests necessary to ensure that your library's docker image will continue working.

### Code sample

For users to understand how the model should be used in your downstream library, we recommend adding a code snippet 
explaining how that should be done. In order to do this, please take a look and update the following file with 
mentions of your library: [interfaces/Libraries.ts](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/interfaces/Libraries.ts). 
This file is in Typescript as this is the ground truth that we're using on the Hugging Face website.
Additionally, this will add a tag with which users may filter models. All models from your library will 
be easily identifiable!

If you're adding a new pipeline, you might also want to take a look at adding it to the 
[Types.ts](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/interfaces/Types.ts) for it to be identifiable 
as a possible pipeline.

Secondly, you should set the 
[widget default for that pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/interfaces/DefaultWidget.ts).

### Implementing a widget

As of now, the widgets are being open sourced. While we work to make them publicly available, please open an issue 
with the widget you would like to have and a description of how it would work with your library.
