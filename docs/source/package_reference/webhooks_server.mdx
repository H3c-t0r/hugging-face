# Webhooks Server

Webhooks are a foundation for MLOps-related features. They allow you to listen for new changes on specific repos or to
all repos belonging to particular set of users/organizations (not just your repos, but any repo). If you want to know
more about webhooks on the Huggingface Hub, you can read this generic [guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/webhooks).

[`WebhooksServer`] is a class to easily start a server that can receive webhooks from the Huggingface Hub. The goal
is to ease setting up your own webhook endpoints, debug them locally and run them in a Space. 

<Tip warning={true}>

This is an experimental feature. This means that we are still working on improving the API. Breaking changes might be
introduced in the future without prior notice. Make sure to pin the version of `huggingface_hub` in your requirements.

## Server

The server is a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) app. It has a UI to display instructions for you or your users and an API
to listen to webhooks. Implementing a webhook endpoint is as simple as decorating a function. You can then debug it
by redirecting Huggingface webhooks to your machine (using a gradio tunnel) before deploying it to a Space.

## Data structure

This is a data structure that represents the payload you would expect from an HF webhook. This is a pydantic class
which makes it very easy to use with FastAPI. If you pass it as a parameter to a webhook endpoint, it will be
automatically validated and parsed as a Python object.
