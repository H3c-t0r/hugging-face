# Filesystem API

Below is the documentation for the `HfFileSystem` class, which provides a pythonic file interface to the Hugging Face Hub based on [`fssepc`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

As the [`HfFileSystem`] is based on [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it is compatible with most of the APIs that it offers. For more details, check out the fsspec's [API Reference](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem).
