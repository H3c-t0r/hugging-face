# Inference

Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. This process can be compute-intensive
which makes it interesting to run on a remote machine. The `huggingface_hub` library provides an easy way to call a
service that runs fast inference for hosted models. There are several services you can connect to:
- [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index): a service that allows you to run accelerated inference
on Hugging Face's infrastructure and for free. This service is a fast way to get started, tests different models and
prototype AI products.
- [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints): a product to easily deploy models to production.
Inference is run by Hugging Face in a dedicated, fully managed infrastructure on the Cloud of your choice.
- [SageMaker Hugging Face Inference Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-huggingface-inference-toolkit)

All of these services can be called with the `InferenceClient` client. Please refer to [this guide](../guides/inference)
for more information on how to use it.

### Return types

For most tasks, the return value has a built-in type (string, list, image...). Here is a list for the more complex types.

## InferenceAPI

`InferenceAPI` is the legacy way to call the Inference API. The interface is more simplistic and requires to know
the input parameters and output format for each task. It also lacks the ability to connect to other services like
Inference Endpoints or AWS SageMaker. It is still supported but we recommend using `InferenceClient` whenever possible.
