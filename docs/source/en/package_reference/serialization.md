# Serialization

`huggingface_hub` contains helpers to help ML libraries serialize models weights in a standardized way. This part of the lib is still under development and will be improved in future releases. The goal is to harmonize how weights are serialized on the Hub, both to remove code duplication across libraries and to foster conventions on the Hub.

## Save torch state dict

The main helper of the `serialization` module takes a state dictionary as input (e.g. a mapping between layer names and related tensors), splits it into several shards while creating a proper index in the process and save everything to disk. At the moment, only `torch` tensors are supported. Under the hood, it delegates the logic to split the state dictionary to [`split_torch_state_dict_into_shards`].

## Split state dict into shards

The `serialization` module also contains low-level helpers to split a state dictionary into several shards, while creating a proper index in the process. These helpers are available for `torch` and `tensorflow` tensors and are designed to be easily extended to any other ML frameworks.

### split_state_dict_into_shards_factory

This is the underlying factory from which each framework-specific helper is derived. In practice, you are not expected to use this factory directly except if you need to adapt it to a framework that is not yet supported. If that is the case, please let us know by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/new) on the `huggingface_hub` repo.
