# Upload files to the Hub

Sharing your files and work is a very important aspect of the Hub. The `huggingface_hub`
uses a Git-based workflow to upload files to the Hub. You can use these functions
independently or integrate them into your own library, making it more convenient for
your users to interact with the Hub. This guide will show you how to:

* Push a single file to the Hub with the [`upload_file`] function.
* Push files with a `commit` context manager.
* Push files with the [`~Repository.push_to_hub`] function.
* Push very large files with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Refer to the following chart to select a uploading method that works best for you and
then read more to learn about it.

Whenever you want to upload files to the Hub, you need to log in to your Hugging Face
account:

1. Log in to your Hugging Face account with the following command:

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

2. Alternatively, if you prefer working from a Jupyter or Colaboratory notebook, login
   with [`notebook_login`]:

   ```python
   >>> from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
   >>> notebook_login()
   ```

   [`notebook_login`] will launch a widget in your notebook from which you can enter
   your Hugging Face credentials.

## Push without Git commands

The [`upload_file`] function uploads a local file to a repository without using Git
commands. You need to provide the path of the local file, the desired path of the file
in the repository, and the repository you want to upload the file to.

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi
>>> api = HfApi()
>>> api.upload_file(path_or_fileobj="/local/path/to/README.md",
...                 path_in_repo="README.md",
...                 repo="lysandre/test-model"
... )
```

## Push files in a single step

The `commit` context manager handles four of the most common Git commands: pull, add,
commit, and push. `git-lfs` automatically tracks any file larger than 10MB. In the
following example, the `commit` context manager:

1. Pulls from the `text-files` repository.
2. Adds a change made to `file.txt`.
3. Commits the change.
4. Pushes the change to the `text-files` repository.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import Repository
>>> with Repository(local_dir="text-files", clone_from="<user>/text-files").commit(commit_message="My first file :)"):
...     with open("file.txt", "w+") as f:
...         f.write(json.dumps({"hey": 8}))
```

Here is another example of how to save and upload a file to a repository:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> model = torch.nn.Transformer()
>>> with Repository("torch-model", clone_from="<user>/torch-model", use_auth_token=True).commit(commit_message="My cool model :)"):
...     torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pt")
```

Set `blocking=False` if you would like to push your commits asynchronously. Non-blocking
behavior is helpful when you want to continue running your script while you push your
commits.

```python
>>> with repo.commit(commit_message="My cool model :)", blocking=False)
```

You can check the status of your push with the `command_queue` method:

```python
>>> last_command = repo.command_queue[-1]
>>> last_command.status
```

Refer to the table below for the possible statuses:

| Status   | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| -1       | The push is ongoing.                 |
| 0        | The push has completed successfully. |
| Non-zero | An error has occurred.               |

When `blocking=False`, commands are tracked, and your script will only exit when all
pushes are completed, even if other errors occur in your script. Some additional useful
commands for checking the status of a push include:

```python
# Inspect an error.
>>> last_command.stderr

# Check whether a push is completed or ongoing.
>>> last_command.is_done

# Check whether a push command has errored.
>>> last_command.failed
```

## Pull before pushing to a repository

The [`Repository`] class also has a [`~Repository.push_to_hub`] function to add files,
make a commit, and push them to a repository. Unlike the `commit` context manager,
[`~Repository.push_to_hub`] requires you to pull from a repository first, save the
files, and then call [`~Repository.push_to_hub`].

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import Repository
>>> repo.git_pull()
>>> repo.push_to_hub(commit_message="Commit my-awesome-file to the Hub")
```

However, if you aren't ready to push a file yet, you can still use
[`~Repository.git_add`] and [`~Repository.git_commit`] to add and commit your file:

```py
>>> repo.git_add("path/to/file")
>>> repo.git_commit(commit_message="add my first model config file :)")
```

Once you're ready, you can push your file to your repository with
[`~Repository.git_push`]:

```py
>>> repo.git_push()
```

## Push large files with Git LFS

For huge files (>5GB), you need to install a custom transfer agent for Git LFS:

```bash
huggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles
```

You should install this for each model repository that contains a model file. Once
installed, you are now able to push files larger than 5GB.
