class WebhookApp:
    """
    The [`WebhookApp`] class lets you create an instance of a Gradio app that can receive Huggingface webhooks.
    These webhooks can be registered using the [`~WebhookApp.add_webhook`] decorator. Webhook endpoints are added to
    the app as a POST endpoint to the FastAPI router. Once all the webhooks are registered, the `run` method has to be
    called to start the app.

    The [`WebhookApp`] is meant to be debugged locally before being deployed to a Space. Local debugging works with
    the HF Hub by opening a tunnel to your machine (using Gradio). You can protect your webhook server by setting a
    `webhook_secret`.

    It is recommended to accept [`WebhookPayload`] as the first argument of the webhook function. It is a Pydantic
    model that contains all the information about the webhook event. The data will be parsed automatically for you.

    Args:
        ui (`gradio.Blocks`, optional):
            A Gradio UI instance that will be use as the Space landing page. If None, a basic interface displaying
            information about the configured webhooks is created.
        webhook_secret (`str`, optional):
            A secret key to verify incoming webhook requests. You can set this value to any secret you want as long as
            you configure it as well in your [webhooks settings panel](https://huggingface.co/settings/webhooks). You
            can also set this value as the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable. If no secret is provided, the
            webhook endpoints are opened without any security.

    Example:

        The quickest way to define a webhook app is to use the [`hf_webhook`] decorator. Under the hood it will create
        a [`WebhookApp`] with the default UI and register the decorated function as a webhook. Multiple webhooks can
        be added in the same script. Once all the webhooks are defined, the `run` method will be called automatically.


        ```python
        from huggingface_hub import hf_webhook, WebhookPayload

        @hf_webhook
        async def trigger_training(payload: WebhookPayload):
            if payload.repo.type == "dataset" and payload.event.action == "update":
                # Trigger a training job if a dataset is updated
                ...
        ```

        If you need more control over the app, you can create a [`WebhookApp`] instance yourself and register webhooks
        as you would register FastAPI routes. The `run` method will have to be called manually to start the app.

        ```python
        import gradio as gr
        from huggingface_hub import WebhookApp, WebhookPayload

        with gr.Blocks as ui:
            ...

        app = WebhookApp(ui=ui, webhook_secret="my_secret_key")

        @app.add_webhook("/say_hello")
        async def hello(payload: WebhookPayload):
            return {"message": "hello"}

        app.run()
        ```
