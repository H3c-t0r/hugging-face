Hi!

Let's bring the documentation to all the <languageName>-speaking community üåê (currently 0 out of 267 complete)

Who would want to translate? Please follow the ü§ó [TRANSLATING guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/docs/TRANSLATING.md). Here is a list of the files ready for translation. Let us know in this issue if you'd like to translate any, and we'll add your name to the list.

Some notes:

* Please translate using an informal tone (imagine you are talking with a friend about huggingface_hub ü§ó).
* Please translate in a gender-neutral way.
* Add your translations to the folder called `<languageCode>` inside the [source folder](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/docs/source).
* Register your translation in `<languageCode>/_toctree.yml`; please follow the order of the [English version](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/docs/source/en/_toctree.yml).
* Once you're finished, open a pull request and tag this issue by including #issue-number in the description, where issue-number is the number of this issue. Please ping @Wauplin @stevhliu for review.
* üôã If you'd like others to help you with the translation, you can also post in the ü§ó [forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/).
