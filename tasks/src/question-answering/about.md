## Use Cases
You can use Question Answering (QA) models to automate answering frequently asked questions by using a knowledge base (documents) as the context. The answers to the questions from customers can be extracted from those documents. 

⚡⚡ If you’d like to save inference time, you can first use [passage ranking models](/tasks/sentence-similarity) to see which document might contain the answer to the question and iterate over that document with the question answering model instead.

## Task Variants
There are different QA variants based on the inputs and outputs:
* Extractive Question Answering: The model **extracts** the answer from a context. The context here could be a provided text, a table or even HTML! This is usually solved with BERT-like models.
* Open Generative Question Answering: The model **generates** free text directly based on the context. You can learn more about text generation in [its task page](/tasks/text-generation). A
* Closed Generative Question Answering: In this case there is no context provided at all. The answer is completely generated by a model.

The schema above illustrates extractive, open book QA. The model takes a context and the question and extract the answer from the given context.

You can also differentiate QA models depending if they are open-domain or closed-domain Open-domain models are not restricted to a specific domain, meanwhile closed-domain models are restricted to a specific domain (e.g. legal, medical documents). 


## Inference
You can infer with QA models with the `transformers` library using the `question-answering` pipeline. If no model checkpoint is given, the pipeline will be initialized with `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`. This pipeline takes a question and a context from which the answer will be extracted and returned.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa_model = pipeline("question-answering")
question = "Where do I live?"
context = "My name is Merve and I live in İstanbul."
qa_model(question = question, context = context)
## {'answer': 'İstanbul', 'end': 39, 'score': 0.9538118243217468, 'start': 31}
```
